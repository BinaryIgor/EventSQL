* performance benchmarks on infra & scripts to reproduce them
* usage examples
    * just pub/sub
    * giving access to event tables as a means of a simple export - since they are all there
* expiring events/TTL?
* compact topics - unique key
* join, aka streams
* more elaborate definitions change support
* JavaDocs
* Support schemas init in registry - why require schemas from users, if it is always the same?
